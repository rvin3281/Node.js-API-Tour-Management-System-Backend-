# Tour Management System API Design (Backend Only)

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to study and learn the process of designing RESTful APIs using Node.js. Through the development of the Tour Management System API, I gained valuable experience and knowledge in various aspects of API design and implementation.

## Features

- Development of a RESTful API for a Tour Management System with four main collections:
  - User
  - Tour
  - Review
  - Auth
- Implementation of JWT authentication and authorization system.
- Integration of MongoDB database with Node.js server.
- Design of protected routes and user restriction routes.
- Utilization of MongoDB aggregation for advanced queries.
- Development for both production and development modes.
- Learning to use Postman for API testing.
- Implementation of HTTP security protocols.
- Optimization of API design for best performance.

## API Documentation

For detailed API documentation and usage examples, please refer to the [Postman Documentation](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/27179304/2s9YJgULeb#d7ae541f-d777-4f68-a3b8-745c27eeb8f1).

## Learning Highlights

Throughout the development of this project, I had the opportunity to gain valuable experience and knowledge in several key areas related to web development and API design. These learning experiences include:

- Building a real-world RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
- Implementing authentication and authorization using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Utilizing Mongoose for MongoDB data modeling and interaction.
- Advanced data modeling techniques, including relationships between data, embedding, and referencing.
- Adopting the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for structured code organization.
- Conducting CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with MongoDB both locally and on the Atlas platform (in the cloud).
- Gaining a deep understanding of Express, including routing, middleware usage, and handling responses.

This project served as a practical learning opportunity, allowing me to apply these concepts and technologies in a real-world scenario. The experience gained here has significantly contributed to my skills as a full-stack developer
